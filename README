        =====================
         MobileSwitch Readme
        =====================

         Requirements
        --------------
 - Running PunBB installation http://punbb.informer.com/
 - Mobiletheme https://github.com/Loa/OxygenMobile

         Usage
        -------
Will switch to mobile style for mobile devices if currently used style exists in $STYLENAME$Mobile version. For example OxygenMobile will be used instead of Oxygen on a mobile device. If current style doesn't have a mobile version then mobileswitch will use OxygenMobile if it exists.

         Recommendations
        -----------------
I will soon release a PunBB extensions that allow a user to specify a specific style for their mobile devices.
